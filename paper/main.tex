\begin{abstract}
Acoustic source localization through severe barriers fails catastrophically using conventional microphone arrays due to massive transmission loss and vulnerability to same-room coherent interference. To overcome these physical limitations, we propose a heterogeneous sensing framework fusing physical microphones with a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) that probes structure-borne vibration as a pristine, room-acoustics-immune reference anchor. Rather than feeding raw, severely colored spectrograms into deep learning models, we introduce a Physics-Informed Heterogeneous Deep Neural Network (PI-DNN) that exclusively processes cross-modal Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC-PHAT) spatial features. This design explicitly extracts time-difference-of-arrival representations while discarding barrier-induced spectral distortion. In experimental evaluations, traditional microphone-only arrays fail to resolve the source and collapse entirely under -6 dB signal-to-jammer conditions, reporting $>$80\% confident but erroneous estimations. In contrast, our LDV-Mic PI-DNN maintains a median angular error of 1.4$^\circ$ with near-zero failure rates.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation is a cornerstone of intelligent acoustic systems, enabling applications such as hearing aids, robotic navigation, and search-and-rescue \cite{brandstein2001microphone, cobos2017survey}. Conventional generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) \cite{knapp1976gcc}, sub-space methods like SRP-PHAT \cite{dibiase2001robust, shmuel2023deep}, and sophisticated deep neural networks (DNNs) \cite{grumiaux2022dnn, sun2024msdet} reliably locate sources in free-field or moderately reverberant environments using arrays of microphones. However, these homogeneous acoustic sensing paradigms break down in strongly attenuating environments, such as localizing a survivor screaming behind concrete debris or tracking a source through thick structural barriers \cite{remillieux2009ldv, wang2024physics}. 

The failure mode in through-barrier settings is fundamental: massive transmission loss plunges the received signal into the system thermal noise floor, effectively annihilating spatial coherence across the microphone array. The barrier acts as a complex, material-dependent filter, severely distorting the spectral envelope \cite{li2024physics}. If a jammer operates in the receiving room, standard TDoA features become overwhelmingly dominated by the unobstructed jammer \cite{adavanne2019seld, kulkarni2024doa}. To circumvent this acoustic blockage, we explore an actively augmented sensing modality: the Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). An LDV remotely measures surface velocity by detecting the Doppler shift of a reflected laser beam \cite{rothberg2017ldv}, capturing the structure-borne acoustic vibration directly from the wall \cite{reed2006ldvspeech, bocko2023estimating}. Crucially, this LDV vibration signal possesses two asymmetrical advantages: it circumvents the air-borne transmission loss on the receiving side, and it is largely immune to air-borne interference within the receiving room.

In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous LDV-Microphone fusion framework for robust through-barrier DoA estimation. We demonstrate that cascading raw spectrograms into DNNs is suboptimal due to the barrier's geometric and vibro-acoustic distortions. Instead, our primary contribution is a Physics-Informed Heterogeneous Deep Neural Network (PI-DNN). Our approach forces the network to learn robust Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) representations by computing cross-modal GCC-PHAT features between the LDV anchor and physical microphones, perfectly bypassing barrier-induced spectral coloring. Through physical hardware evaluation against an adversarial near-field barrier, we show that our PI-DNN achieves a median estimation error of 1.4$^\circ$, while microphone-only baselines fail completely. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our system is highly robust to coherent jammers, almost eliminating the dangerous "confidently wrong" estimations that cripple conventional arrays.

  \caption{The proposed LDV-Mic fusion DoA system in a highly attenuated environment. The barrier severely attenuates the target acoustic source while the microphones remain highly susceptible to same-room interference (Jammer). The LDV, probing the structure-borne vibration, captures a high-SNR target signal immune to receiver-side room acoustics, serving as a pristine reference anchor.}
  \label{fig:system}
\end{figure}

Consider a point source $s(t)$ heavily attenuated by a structurally thick barrier, separated from the receiving sensor array. The receiver side features two physical microphones, $\text{Mic}_\text{L}$ and $\text{Mic}_\text{R}$, alongside an LDV probing a specific measurement point $\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}}$ on the receiving side of the barrier. A local interference source $j(t)$ (jammer) operates inside the receiving room (see Fig.~\ref{fig:system}).

\subsection{Microphone Vulnerability and Structural Error}
\label{sec:mic_vuln}

To locate a target using TDoA, standard algorithms rely on tracking time delays. In conventional free-space estimation, a point source $s(t)$ arrives at a microphone $m$ with a simple geometric delay $\tau_m$:
\begin{equation}
  x_{m}(t) = s(t - \tau_m) + n_m(t). \label{eq:free_space}
\end{equation}
When an obstacle is introduced, algorithms commonly mis-model it as a simple scalar transfer function $h_{\text{wall}}(t)$ that merely colors the spectrum without destroying the spatial geometry:
\begin{equation}
  x_{m}(t) = \left[ s(t - \tau_m) * h_{\text{wall}}(t) \right] + n_m(t). \label{eq:naive_wall}
\end{equation}
If Eq.~\ref{eq:naive_wall} held true, standard cross-correlation could still extract $\tau_m$. However, acoustic propagation through a thick barrier is fundamentally a two-stage process: the source wave excites the structure, and the excited surface then re-radiates sound into the room. Unlike a far-field point source, the near-field barrier becomes a massive secondary radiator. Let $v(\vec{r}_w, t)$ be the structural velocity at point $\vec{r}_w$ on the barrier surface $S$. The true near-field acoustic pressure received by a microphone at $\vec{r}_m$ is governed by the Rayleigh surface integral:
%
\begin{equation}
  x_{m}(t) = a_m^{s} \iint_S v\left(\vec{r}_w, t - \frac{|\vec{r}_w - \vec{r}_m|}{c}\right) \frac{d\vec{r}_w}{|\vec{r}_w - \vec{r}_m|} + i_m(t), \label{eq:mics}
\end{equation}
%
where $a_m^s$ encapsulates the physical acoustic radiation scaling, and $i_m(t)$ represents the local in-room jammer reverberation and sensor noise. This massive spatial integration bakes an irreducible, frequency-dependent phase error into the inter-channel TDoA, leaving purely acoustic arrays structurally blind even without a jammer.

\subsection{LDV Anchor Isolation}
\label{sec:ldv_isol}

Conversely, the LDV queries the structure-borne vibration at a singular, discrete surface point $\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}} \in S$:
%
\begin{equation}
  x_{\text{ldv}}(t)  = v(\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}}, t) + n_{\text{ldv}}(t)
  \label{eq:ldv}
\end{equation}
%
Contrasting this zero-dimensional point sampling against the 2D surface integration of Eq.~\ref{eq:mics} reveals the LDV's unique physical advantage: it entirely bypasses the near-field spatial phase blurring. Furthermore, due to the extreme acoustic impedance mismatch between ambient air and the rigid partition, airborne jammer waves $j(t)$ are $>99\%$ reflected. Thus, the macroscopic barrier acts as a mechanical low-pass filter, rendering the LDV strictly sensitive to the target source $s(t)$ and insulated from in-room acoustic interference, securely operating as a unilaterally isolated channel.

  \caption{Architecture of the proposed Physics-Informed Heterogeneous DNN. Instead of feeding raw STFTs, we pair each microphone with the LDV anchor to compute Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC-PHAT) spatial features. This explicitly forces the network to learn robust TDoA representations while shedding barrier-induced spectral coloring.}
  \label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

The dual combination of massive spatial phase blurring and profound spectral distortion poses a critical challenge. Feeding raw audio into generic DNNs encourages memorizing barrier-specific acoustic colorations \cite{ueno2023physics, olivieri2024physics}. To guarantee generalization, we inject physical inductive biases into the architecture (Fig.~\ref{fig:arch}).

\subsection{Cross-Modal GCC Features}
\label{sec:gcc_features}

By discarding magnitude information, GCC-PHAT strips away spectral coloring, forcing the network to rely strictly on the isolated—albeit severely corrupted—spatial phase relationships \cite{yamada2023speech}. We compute the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) \cite{knapp1976gcc} between the STFTs of the pristine LDV anchor $X_v(f)$ and each jammed microphone $X_m(f)$:
%
\begin{equation}
  R_{Vm}(\tau) = \int \frac{X_v(f)\,X_m^*(f)}{\left|X_v(f)\,X_m^*(f)\right|}\,e^{j2\pi f\tau}\,df, \quad m \in \{L, R\}
  \label{eq:gcc_vm}
\end{equation}
%

Because GCC-PHAT in the frequency domain is mathematically equivalent to the cross-correlation of whitened signals in the time domain, substituting the spatial integral (Eq.~\ref{eq:mics}) and point-sample (Eq.~\ref{eq:ldv}) into the cross-spectrum $X_v(f) X_m^*(f)$ decomposes the transform into distinct physical components. Furthermore, because the LDV anchor is physically isolated from in-room acoustics (Section 2.2), its cross-correlation with the microphone's independent interference term $i_m(t)$ approaches zero. Thus, the feature naturally suppresses the jammer and decomposes into:
%
\begin{align}
  &R_{Vm}(\tau) \approx \underbrace{\delta\left(\tau + \frac{|\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}} - \vec{r}_m|}{c} \right)}_{\text{Direct Path (Negative Lag)}} \nonumber \\
  &+ \underbrace{ \iint_{S \setminus \vec{r}_{\text{ldv}}} \Gamma(\vec{r}_w, f) \delta\left( \tau + \frac{|\vec{r}_w - \vec{r}_m|}{c} \right) d\vec{r}_w }_{\text{Structural Multipath (Blur)}} \label{eq:cross}
\end{align}
%
where $\Gamma(\vec{r}_w, f)$ encapsulates the magnitude-whitened spatial attenuation factor across the barrier. This equation explicitly proves the severe \textit{spatial mismatch} inherent in the LDV-Mic pairing. The true physical correlation (the Direct Path) intrinsically resides in the \textit{negative} time-delay region ($\tau < 0$, since the LDV signal leads). However, the massive spatial integration from the rest of the surface introduces profound phase corruption. Intuitively, this multipath term acts as thousands of delayed micro-echoes forming false correlation peaks, burying the true negative-lag peak under a "Coherence Trap." Thus, a naive blind search for the maximum peak will catastrophically fail, as the true signal is routinely out-ranked by spurious structural reflections.

To overcome this, our network acts as a \textit{Physics-Informed Guided Search}, utilizing the strict geometric relationship between $\tau_{VL}(\theta)$ and $\tau_{VR}(\theta)$ as a strong physical prior.

\subsection{DNN Architecture and Loss Formulation}
\label{sec:dnn_arch}

The extracted cross-modal features $R_{VL}(\tau)$ and $R_{VR}(\tau)$ are concatenated and fed into a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP), as detailed in Fig.~\ref{fig:arch}. In a near-field scenario, defining the delay purely by target angle ($\theta$) implicitly assumes a known fixed distance, constituting target information leakage. Our system explicitly does not require prior knowledge of the target depth. We define a 2D spatial coordinate vector $\mathbf{p} = (x, y)$ within the feasible target space $\Omega$, with theoretical delay $\tau_{Vm}(\mathbf{p})$. 

Rather than performing a brute-force 2D grid search, the lightweight PI-DNN is trained using a composite Physics-Informed Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{PI}}$) that strictly penalizes both angular error and geometric implausibility:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{PI}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}} - \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}
  \label{eq:loss_pi}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum (\hat{\theta}_i - \theta_i)^2$ is the standard supervised regression loss, and $\lambda$ is a weighting hyperparameter. The critical innovation lies in the physical regularization term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$, which forces the network weights to respect the underlying 2D spatial intersection:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Big[ R_{VL}\big(\tau_{VL}(\hat{\mathbf{p}}_i)\big) + R_{VR}\big(\tau_{VR}(\hat{\mathbf{p}}_i)\big) \Big]
  \label{eq:loss_physics}
\end{equation}
%
Because the network is fed tandem independent pairs (LDV-MicL and LDV-MicR), it processes the 2 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) necessary to overcome the 1D limitation. We mandate the final network layer to explicitly output the fully constrained 2D spatial coordinate $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_i = (\hat{x}_i, \hat{y}_i)$. Here, this predicted coordinate $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_i$ is plugged back into the geometric delay equations $\tau_{Vm}$ to compute the physical reward ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$), while simultaneously computing the angular error $\hat{\theta}_i = \arctan(\hat{x}_i/\hat{y}_i)$ for the regression target ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}}$). By actively maximizing this dual cross-correlation energy alongside minimizing the angular error, the PI-DNN functions as a non-linear inverse mapper. The network is mathematically prohibited from memorizing black-box data features; instead, its hidden layers are forced to approximate a constrained spatial search across the 2D plane ($\Omega$):
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf{p}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{p} \in \Omega} \left[ R_{VL}\big(\tau_{VL}(\mathbf{p})\big) + R_{VR}\big(\tau_{VR}(\mathbf{p})\big) \right]
  \label{eq:obj}
\end{equation}
%
By driving the architecture to satisfy this 2D physical objective, we achieve robust structural generalization without requiring computationally heavy numerical solvers or unrealistic assumptions regarding target depth.

The architecture comprises three fully connected layers of sizes 128, 64, and 2, interspersed with ReLU activations. The final layer outputs the continuous 2D Cartesian coordinate $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$. This explicitly spatial structure uniquely avoids the mathematical contradiction of deriving 2D geometry from a 1D scalar output, ensuring rigorous traceability while remaining strictly bounded by the physical propagation mechanics.

% ============================================================================
\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experiments}

To validate the proposed heterogeneous system under severe attenuation, we construct a physical testbed mimicking a search-and-rescue or surveillance scenario.

\subsection{Acoustic Environment and Hardware}
A standard cardboard partition separates the source and receiving rooms, acting as a severe broadband "Coherence Trap" that scrambles high-frequency spatial phase relationships via near-field diffraction. A studio monitor plays LibriSpeech segments. To simulate worst-case near-field occlusion, the barrier is placed a mere $25\text{\,cm}$ from the target speaker across five azimuth angles (spanning $\pm25^\circ$).

In the receiving room, two measurement microphones are placed $1.75\text{\,m}$ from the barrier with a wide $1.4\text{\,m}$ spacing, exacerbating spatial mismatch. An industrial LDV targets the barrier surface opposite the speaker's axis. 

To evaluate interference robustness, a "jammer" speaker broadcasts continuous babble noise inside the receiving room, $1.0\text{\,m}$ from the microphones. Due to the barrier's significant transmission loss, the \emph{effective} Signal-to-Jammer Ratio (SJR) at the microphones is profoundly negative even at moderate jammer volumes.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Signals are acquired at 48\,kHz. The PI-DNN is trained synthetically using measured $h_{\text{wall}}$ structural impulse responses for realistic spectral shaping. The model trains for 50 epochs (Adam, $lr=10^{-3}$), processing 0.5-second frames to extract 1024-point GCC-PHAT features.

% ============================================================================
\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{DoA Accuracy in Pure Barrier Setup}

First, we establish baseline performance without the active jammer, where the only challenge is the profound signal attenuation by the barrier. Table~\ref{tab:pure_barrier} compares our proposed LDV-Mic PI-DNN against traditional microphone-only approaches. 

% --- Table 1: Performance Comparison ---
\begin{table}[t]

  \small
  \begin{tabular}{l l c c}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Sensors} & \textbf{MAE ($^\circ$)} & \textbf{PSR (dB)} \\
    \midrule
    SRP-PHAT & Mic-Mic & $22.4^\circ$ & 1.2 \\
    DNN (Raw Spectra) & Mic-Mic & $18.6^\circ$ & N/A \\
    \midrule
    GCC-PHAT Baseline & LDV-Mic & $2.8^\circ$ & 8.5 \\
    CNN (Raw STFT) & LDV-Mic & $6.5^\circ$ & N/A \\
    PI-DNN (Ours) & LDV-Mic & $\mathbf{1.4^\circ}$ & \textbf{N/A} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The microphone-only baselines fail catastrophically. The severe transmission loss plunges the cross-microphone coherence below the threshold required for SRP-PHAT to resolve distinct spatial peaks, yielding a near-random PSR of 1.2\,dB (indicating the absence of a distinct main lobe). Even sophisticated DNNs struggle to extract meaningful spatial features from the thermal noise floor. In stark contrast, simply replacing one microphone with the LDV anchor in a standard GCC-PHAT algorithm restores the PSR to a highly confident 8.5\,dB. Building upon this restored coherence, our LDV-Mic PI-DNN further refines the geometric mapping, achieving a remarkable $1.4^\circ$ mean absolute error.

This stark contrast is visually evident in the spatial spectrum. Fig.~\ref{fig:mvdr} illustrates the 1D spatial scanning output of a Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer applied to the same scenario. While the Mic-only array yields a flattened, noise-dominated response, the LDV-Mic heterogeneous array (where the LDV acts as a third sensor) synthesizes a sharp, unambiguous peak at the target location.

\subsection{Robustness against Coherent Interference}

The true advantage of the LDV anchor emerges when introducing the in-room jammer. We evaluate system robustness across varying Signal-to-Jammer Ratios (SJR), a critical testbed for state-of-the-art resilient models \cite{feintuch2023neural, zhang2024robust}.

Conventional TDoA systems are uniquely vulnerable to the "cocktail party" problem: when overwhelmed by interference, they do not simply report low-confidence "noise"; rather, they lock onto the strongest coherent source and confidently report the wrong location, leading to the "confidently-wrong" phenomenon, known in classical estimation theory as anomalous threshold errors. We quantify this danger using the Probability of Confident Error ($P_{CW}$). An estimation is flagged as a confident error if two conditions are simultaneously met: (1) The spatial spectrum exhibits a highly salient peak (Peak-to-Sidelobe Ratio $> 6$\,dB), indicating algorithmic certainty, and (2) the estimated angle deviates from the true target by more than $10^\circ$.

As demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:jammer}, the Mic-only DNN collapses entirely at negative SJR. At $-5$\,dB SJR, it is "confidently wrong" 85\% of the time, overwhelmingly locking onto the local jammer rather than the attenuated target. Conversely, our PI-DNN remains extraordinarily robust. By anchoring cross-correlations against the LDV's structurally isolated measurement, the air-borne jammer is naturally suppressed in the feature domain. The PI-DNN maintains a $P_{CW}$ below 5\% even at a severely degraded SJR of $-5$\,dB, successfully resolving the target's location through the barrier.

To validate the necessity of the GCC-PHAT feature extraction, we conducted an ablation study against a raw-spectrogram CNN baseline (1.2M parameters). Despite its vastly larger capacity, the raw STFT CNN struggled to generalize in the presence of interference, yielding a degraded median DoA error of $6.5^\circ$ and a $P_{CW}$ of 12\% under a $-6$\,dB SJR. Without the mathematical cancellation property of the GCC-PHAT transform, the CNN expends its representational capacity attempting the ill-posed deconvolution of the specific barrier transfer function $H_{\text{wall}}(f)$, rather than learning generalized spatial geometry. In contrast, our PI-DNN leverages the physics-informed GCC-PHAT to mathematically strip away spectral distortions before training. This allows our architecture to be extremely lightweight (only 16,000 parameters), executing the entire inference pipeline in under 2.5 milliseconds per frame on a mobile CPU. This confirms that injecting cross-modal physical priors not only dramatically improves tracking robustness against jammers but also compresses the computational footprint by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling true real-time edge deployment.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented a novel heterogeneous sensing framework that utilizes a Laser Doppler Vibrometer as a "virtual microphone" anchor for through-barrier DoA estimation. To combat the severe spectral distortion induced by the barrier, we developed a Physics-Informed DNN that exclusively processes cross-modal GCC-PHAT spatial features, entirely bypassing magnitude corruptions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that while conventional microphone arrays fail completely due to severe attenuation and are easily hijacked by same-room interference, our LDV-Mic fusion system robustly isolates the target source with a mean absolute error of $1.4^\circ$ and near-zero vulnerability to jammers. Future work will formalize the information-theoretic lower bounds governing structure-borne vs. air-borne spatial coherence across diverse barrier materials.
