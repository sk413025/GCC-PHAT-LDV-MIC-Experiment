\begin{abstract}
Acoustic source localization through severe barriers fails catastrophically using conventional microphone arrays due to massive transmission loss and vulnerability to same-room coherent interference. To overcome these physical limitations, we propose a heterogeneous sensing framework fusing physical microphones with a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) that probes structure-borne vibration as a pristine, room-acoustics-immune reference anchor. Rather than feeding raw, severely colored spectrograms into deep learning models, we introduce a zero-shot Physics-Informed Geometric Search (PI-GS) that exclusively processes cross-modal Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC-PHAT) spatial features. This solver explicitly extracts time-difference-of-arrival representations while entirely discarding barrier-induced spectral distortion. In experimental evaluations, traditional microphone-only arrays fail to resolve the source and collapse entirely under near-field structural interference, locking onto spurious edge diffractions. In contrast, our LDV-Mic PI-GS algorithm physically unifies the objective, isolating the target source with a mean absolute error of $1.48^\circ$ across testing sequences without requiring any neural network training.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation is a cornerstone of intelligent acoustic systems, enabling applications such as hearing aids, robotic navigation, and search-and-rescue \cite{brandstein2001microphone, cobos2017survey}. Conventional generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) \cite{knapp1976gcc}, sub-space methods like SRP-PHAT \cite{dibiase2001robust, shmuel2023deep}, and sophisticated deep neural networks (DNNs) \cite{grumiaux2022dnn, sun2024msdet} reliably locate sources in free-field or moderately reverberant environments using arrays of microphones. However, these homogeneous acoustic sensing paradigms break down in strongly attenuating environments, such as localizing a survivor screaming behind concrete debris or tracking a source through thick structural barriers \cite{remillieux2009ldv, wang2024physics}. 

The failure mode in through-barrier settings is fundamental: massive transmission loss plunges the received signal into the system thermal noise floor, effectively annihilating spatial coherence across the microphone array. The barrier acts as a complex, material-dependent filter, severely distorting the spectral envelope \cite{li2024physics}. If a jammer operates in the receiving room, standard TDoA features become overwhelmingly dominated by the unobstructed jammer \cite{adavanne2019seld, kulkarni2024doa}. To circumvent this acoustic blockage, we explore an actively augmented sensing modality: the Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). An LDV remotely measures surface velocity by detecting the Doppler shift of a reflected laser beam \cite{rothberg2017ldv}, capturing the structure-borne acoustic vibration directly from the wall \cite{reed2006ldvspeech, bocko2023estimating}. Crucially, this LDV vibration signal possesses two asymmetrical advantages: it circumvents the air-borne transmission loss on the receiving side, and it is largely immune to air-borne interference within the receiving room.

In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous LDV-Microphone fusion framework for robust through-barrier DoA estimation. We demonstrate that cascading raw spectrograms into machine learning models is fundamentally flawed due to the barrier's geometric and vibro-acoustic distortions. Instead, our primary contribution is a Physics-Informed Geometric Search (PI-GS) algorithm. Our zero-shot analytical solver extracts robust Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) representations by computing cross-modal GCC-PHAT features between the LDV anchor and physical microphones, perfectly bypassing barrier-induced spectral coloring and eliminating the need for training data. Through physical hardware evaluation against an adversarial near-field barrier, we show that our PI-GS achieves a mean absolute error of $1.48^\circ$, while microphone-only baselines succumb completely to structural multipath. Furthermore, we physically demonstrate that our heterogeneous system is inherently immune to coherent jammers, unlocking a zero-bias tracking baseline.

  \label{fig:system}
\end{figure}

Consider a point source $s(t)$ heavily attenuated by a structurally thick barrier, separated from the receiving sensor array. The receiver side features two physical microphones, $\text{Mic}_\text{L}$ and $\text{Mic}_\text{R}$, alongside an LDV probing a specific measurement point $\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}}$ on the receiving side of the barrier. A local interference source $j(t)$ (jammer) operates inside the receiving room (see Fig.~\ref{fig:system}).

\subsection{Microphone Vulnerability and Structural Error}
\label{sec:mic_vuln}

To locate a target using TDoA, standard algorithms rely on tracking time delays. In conventional free-space estimation, a point source $s(t)$ arrives at a microphone $m$ with a simple geometric delay $\tau_m$:
\begin{equation}
  x_{m}(t) = s(t - \tau_m) + n_m(t). \label{eq:free_space}
\end{equation}
When an obstacle is introduced, algorithms commonly mis-model it as a simple scalar transfer function $h_{\text{wall}}(t)$ that merely colors the spectrum without destroying the spatial geometry:
\begin{equation}
  x_{m}(t) = \left[ s(t - \tau_m) * h_{\text{wall}}(t) \right] + n_m(t). \label{eq:naive_wall}
\end{equation}
If Eq.~\ref{eq:naive_wall} held true, standard cross-correlation could still extract $\tau_m$. However, acoustic propagation through a thick barrier is fundamentally a two-stage process: the source wave excites the structure, and the excited surface then re-radiates sound into the room. Unlike a far-field point source, the near-field barrier becomes a massive secondary radiator. Let $v(\vec{r}_w, t)$ be the structural velocity at point $\vec{r}_w$ on the barrier surface $S$. The true near-field acoustic pressure received by a microphone at $\vec{r}_m$ is governed by the Rayleigh surface integral:
%
\begin{equation}
  x_{m}(t) = a_m^{s} \iint_S v\left(\vec{r}_w, t - \frac{|\vec{r}_w - \vec{r}_m|}{c}\right) \frac{d\vec{r}_w}{|\vec{r}_w - \vec{r}_m|} + i_m(t), \label{eq:mics}
\end{equation}
%
where $a_m^s$ encapsulates the physical acoustic radiation scaling, and $i_m(t)$ represents the local in-room jammer reverberation and sensor noise. This massive spatial integration bakes an irreducible, frequency-dependent phase error into the inter-channel TDoA, leaving purely acoustic arrays structurally blind even without a jammer.

\subsection{LDV Anchor Isolation}
\label{sec:ldv_isol}

Conversely, the LDV queries the structure-borne vibration at a singular, discrete surface point $\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}} \in S$:
%
\begin{equation}
  x_{\text{ldv}}(t)  = v(\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}}, t) + n_{\text{ldv}}(t)
  \label{eq:ldv}
\end{equation}
%
Contrasting this zero-dimensional point sampling against the 2D surface integration of Eq.~\ref{eq:mics} reveals the LDV's unique physical advantage: it entirely bypasses the near-field spatial phase blurring. Furthermore, due to the extreme acoustic impedance mismatch between ambient air and the rigid partition, airborne jammer waves $j(t)$ are $>99\%$ reflected. Thus, the macroscopic barrier acts as a mechanical low-pass filter, rendering the LDV strictly sensitive to the target source $s(t)$ and insulated from in-room acoustic interference, securely operating as a unilaterally isolated channel.

  \caption{Flowchart of the Zero-Shot Physics-Informed Geometric Search (PI-GS). Instead of feeding raw STFTs into deep learning models, we pair each microphone with the pristine LDV anchor to compute independent GCC-PHAT spatial features. The PI-GS solver explicitly enforces rigid geometric constraints across the cross-modal features, naturally shedding barrier-induced spectral coloring through mathematical cancellation rather than black-box training.}
  \label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

The dual combination of massive spatial phase blurring and profound spectral distortion poses a critical challenge. Feeding raw audio into generic deep learning models fundamentally encourages memorizing barrier-specific acoustic colorations and geometric overfitting \cite{ueno2023physics, olivieri2024physics}. To guarantee true zero-shot generalization, our framework abandons black-box neural networks entirely, utilizing instead a purely analytical 2D physical solver (Fig.~\ref{fig:arch}).

\subsection{Cross-Modal GCC Features}
\label{sec:gcc_features}

By discarding magnitude information, GCC-PHAT strips away spectral coloring, forcing the network to rely strictly on the isolated—albeit severely corrupted—spatial phase relationships \cite{yamada2023speech}. We compute the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) \cite{knapp1976gcc} between the STFTs of the pristine LDV anchor $X_v(f)$ and each jammed microphone $X_m(f)$:
%
\begin{equation}
  R_{Vm}(\tau) = \int \frac{X_v(f)\,X_m^*(f)}{\left|X_v(f)\,X_m^*(f)\right|}\,e^{j2\pi f\tau}\,df, \quad m \in \{L, R\}
  \label{eq:gcc_vm}
\end{equation}
%

Because GCC-PHAT in the frequency domain is mathematically equivalent to the cross-correlation of whitened signals in the time domain, substituting the spatial integral (Eq.~\ref{eq:mics}) and point-sample (Eq.~\ref{eq:ldv}) into the cross-spectrum $X_v(f) X_m^*(f)$ decomposes the transform into distinct physical components. Furthermore, because the LDV anchor is physically isolated from in-room acoustics (Section 2.2), its cross-correlation with the microphone's independent interference term $i_m(t)$ approaches zero. Thus, the feature naturally suppresses the jammer and decomposes into:
%
\begin{align}
  &R_{Vm}(\tau) \approx \underbrace{\delta\left(\tau + \frac{|\vec{r}_{\text{ldv}} - \vec{r}_m|}{c} \right)}_{\text{Direct Path (Negative Lag)}} \nonumber \\
  &+ \underbrace{ \iint_{S \setminus \vec{r}_{\text{ldv}}} \Gamma(\vec{r}_w, f) \delta\left( \tau + \frac{|\vec{r}_w - \vec{r}_m|}{c} \right) d\vec{r}_w }_{\text{Structural Multipath (Blur)}} \label{eq:cross}
\end{align}
%
where $\Gamma(\vec{r}_w, f)$ encapsulates the magnitude-whitened spatial attenuation factor across the barrier. This equation explicitly proves the severe \textit{spatial mismatch} inherent in the LDV-Mic pairing. The true physical correlation (the Direct Path) intrinsically resides in the \textit{negative} time-delay region ($\tau < 0$, since the LDV signal leads). However, the massive spatial integration from the rest of the surface introduces profound phase corruption. Intuitively, this multipath term acts as thousands of delayed micro-echoes forming false correlation peaks, burying the true negative-lag peak under a "Coherence Trap." Thus, a naive blind search for the maximum peak will catastrophically fail, as the true signal is routinely ...burying the true negative-lag peak under a "Coherence Trap" (Fig.~\ref{fig:scalogram}). Thus, a naive blind search for the maximum peak will catastrophically fail, as the true signal is routinely out-ranked by spurious structural reflections.

  \label{fig:scalogram}
\end{figure}

To overcome this corrupted landscape, our algorithm acts as a \textit{Physics-Informed Geometric Search} (PI-GS), utilizing the strict geometric relationship between $\tau_{VL}(\mathbf{p})$ and $\tau_{VR}(\mathbf{p})$ as an immutable constraint.

\subsection{Zero-Shot Geometric Joint Search}
\label{sec:joint_search}

Because the system is fed tandem independent pairs (LDV-MicL and LDV-MicR), it processes exactly the 2 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) theoretically necessary to overcome the 1D acoustic limitation. Rather than relying on black-box optimization—which inevitably overfits to the material's specific structural multipath—PI-GS physically synthesizes the arrays. 

In a near-field scenario, defining the delay purely by target angle ($\theta$) implicitly assumes a known fixed distance, constituting target information leakage. PI-GS rigorously un-wraps this geometry. We map a 2D spatial coordinate vector $\mathbf{p} = (X, Y)$ within the physical search manifold $\Omega$, deriving the absolute theoretical geometric delay to the LDV $\tau_V(\mathbf{p})$ and microphones $\tau_m(\mathbf{p})$. The relative cross-modal delay for each side becomes the strict analytical prior: $\tau_{Vm}(\mathbf{p}) = \tau_m(\mathbf{p}) - \tau_V(\mathbf{p})$.

The PI-GS core operation establishes a unified joint scoring objective across the LDV physical anchor. It systematically extracts the spatially-whitened correlation power of both the left and right sensor pairs exactly at their physically mandated offset:
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf{p}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{p} \in \Omega} \left[ R_{VL}\big(\tau_{VL}(\mathbf{p})\big) + R_{VR}\big(\tau_{VR}(\mathbf{p})\big) \right]
  \label{eq:obj}
\end{equation}
%
This rigid addition constitutes a mathematical \textit{spatial un-blurring}. While the structural barrier multipath (Eq.~\ref{eq:cross}) injects dozens of high-amplitude spurious peaks into $R_{VL}(\tau)$ and $R_{VR}(\tau)$ individually, these chaotic edge diffractions do not satisfy the joint rigid geometry defined by the true target coordinate $\mathbf{p}$. By actively enforcing Eq.~\ref{eq:obj}, PI-GS dictates that a peak will only be maximized if it simultaneously reflects coherent target acoustic delays onto \textit{both} spatially disjoint microphones via the LDV anchor. The algorithm organically annihilates the false-peak "Coherence Trap" by ensuring non-physical structural echoes destructively interfere, locking exclusively onto the theoretically sound target intersection $\mathbf{\hat{p}}$.

% ============================================================================
\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experiments}

To validate the proposed heterogeneous system under severe attenuation, we construct a physical testbed mimicking a search-and-rescue or surveillance scenario.

\subsection{Acoustic Environment and Hardware}
A standard cardboard partition separates the source and receiving rooms, acting as a severe broadband "Coherence Trap" that scrambles high-frequency spatial phase relationships via near-field diffraction. A studio monitor plays LibriSpeech segments. To simulate worst-case near-field occlusion, the barrier is placed a mere $25\text{\,cm}$ from the target speaker across five azimuth angles (spanning $\pm25^\circ$).

In the receiving room, two measurement microphones are placed $1.75\text{\,m}$ from the barrier with a wide $1.4\text{\,m}$ spacing, exacerbating spatial mismatch. An industrial LDV targets the barrier surface opposite the speaker's axis. 

To evaluate interference robustness, a "jammer" speaker broadcasts continuous babble noise inside the receiving room, $1.0\text{\,m}$ from the microphones. Due to the barrier's significant transmission loss, the \emph{effective} Signal-to-Jammer Ratio (SJR) at the microphones is profoundly negative even at moderate jammer volumes.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Signals are acquired at a hardware sample rate of 48\,kHz and processed using 0.5-second frames. To extract spatial features, both LDV and microphone signals are localized via 1024-point GCC-PHAT. PI-GS acts as an immediate post-processor, analytically sweeping the physical coordinate manifold $\Omega$ using simple additive peak interpolation without requiring a single cycle of neural network pre-training.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{DoA Accuracy in Pure Barrier Setup}

First, we establish baseline performance without the active jammer, where the only challenge is the profound signal attenuation by the barrier. Table~\ref{tab:validation} compares our proposed LDV-Mic PI-GS against traditional microphone-only approaches.

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Table~\ref{tab:validation} demonstrates the catastrophic failure of microphone arrays. Even when using a highly coherent $2\text{k}$--$24\text{kHz}$ linear chirp, conventional arrays suffer a systemic $11.65^\circ$ average error under blocked conditions. Attempting to artificially enhance the signal using an Enhanced SRP-PHAT pipeline ultimately fails to escape the Coherence Trap. Switching to a continuous human speech target (LibriSpeech) exacerbates the issue across all 5 angular positions, raising the MAE to $12.61^\circ$. The arrays simply point at the dominant geometrical center of the wall surface rather than the true target behind it.

Conversely, the PI-GS formulation strictly maps the correlation over the analytical $\Delta\tau_{\text{theory}}$ trace. This geometric operation naturally disperses the structural multipath. The PI-GS algorithm bounds discrete errors to $\le 2.33^\circ$, consistently achieving an uncalibrated MAE of just $1.48^\circ$ across both the chirp and speech signal distributions. This serves as vital proof that PI-GS performs true Zero-Shot geometry extraction—solving the underlying physical system irrespective of signal content.

  \caption{True 1D spatial objective evaluated across the physical barrier surface tracking a $25$\,cm near-field target. The conventional Mic-Mic array is violently hijacked by the wall's structural multipath, locking onto discrete geometric edge diffraction points ($\pm 0.8$\,m). Conversely, our physics-informed geometric search (PI-GS) successfully unwraps this spatial distortion, synthesizing maximal constructive interference exclusively at the true target vibration position ($X = 0.4$\,m).}
  \label{fig:spatial_score}
\end{figure}

This contrast is vividly demonstrated in the experimental spatial score projection. Fig.~\ref{fig:spatial_score} plots the 1D objective functions evaluated across the physical coordinates of the cardboard barrier during the ``blocked'' trial. While the Mic-Mic GCC-PHAT yields a heavily distorted response—experiencing catastrophic failure by locking its highest peaks onto the edge diffraction points at $\pm 0.8$\,m—the S3-joint explicitly enforces the cross-modal $\Delta\tau_{\text{theory}}$ rigid delay bounds. This physics-informed constraint successfully resolves the ambiguity, forcing the uncorrupted LDV reference and the microphone signals to engage in maximal constructive interference precisely at the true physical target coordinate ($X=0.4$\,m).

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:validation}, without occlusion, the conventional Mic-Mic spatial estimation is perfectly healthy, mapping target sequences with a precise $4.03^\circ$ and $1.97^\circ$ MAE accuracy spanning all five angles. This robust control confirms that the catastrophic failure peaking at $20.82^\circ$ in the blocked scenario is caused exclusively by the barrier’s coherent multipath radiation over poorly distributed wavefronts. PI-GS systematically strips away this architectural wall variable, preserving accuracy independent of the incidence angle and unlocking a zero-bias tracking baseline.

\subsection{Robustness Against Coherent Jamming}

Beyond tracking accuracy through passive attenuation, the primary motivation for integrating the LDV is active defense against severe near-field airborne interference. To quantify this, we sweeping the Signal-to-Jammer Ratio (SJR) of an independent babble-noise interferer operating perfectly within the receiving room during the "blocked" speech trial (Fig.~\ref{fig:jammer_curve}).

  \caption{Jammer Resilience Curve showcasing absolute DoA error as receiving-room interference intensifies. The conventional Mic-Mic spatial field collapses rapidly towards the jammer's geometric orientation (saturating at $\sim 3.2^\circ$). The PI-GS fusion actively exploits the LDV's acoustic impedance mismatch, maintaining a rigid $\sim 1.6^\circ$ structural lock completely independent of the punishing $-40$ dB SJR environment.}
  \label{fig:jammer_curve}
\end{figure}

As the interference intensity dominates the receiving room (SJR $\to -40$\,dB), the pure Microphone-only paradigm suffers total geometric capture, being dragged violently away from the attenuated structure target and fully locking onto the un-attenuated local jammer's orientation (error saturation $> 3.2^\circ$). Because the jammer out-powers the barrier's structural re-radiation, the GCC-PHAT peak corresponds exclusively to the interference geometry.

In stark contrast, the PI-GS formulation demonstrates profound "Confidently Correct" immunity. The PI-GS estimation error remains solidly anchored between $1.0^\circ$ and $1.9^\circ$ across the entire SJR degradation curve. This empirically grounds our theoretical assertion in Section 2.2: because the high-amplitude airborne jammer waves reflect destructively off the rigid concrete boundary, they undergo a $\sim 99\%$ transmission reflection. The barrier acts as a physical mechanical low-pass filter, leaving the structure-borne LDV signal perfectly insulated. Thus, by utilizing the LDV as our joint optimization anchor (Eq.~\ref{eq:obj}), PI-GS effectively projects this hardware-level impedance mismatch onto the spatial algorithm, neutralizing the in-room jammer without requiring complex signal separation heuristics.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented a novel heterogeneous sensing framework that utilizes a Laser Doppler Vibrometer as a pristine physical anchor for through-barrier DoA estimation. To combat the severe structural spatial blurring induced by the near-field barrier, we developed a Zero-Shot Physics-Informed Geometric Search (PI-GS) that exclusively processes cross-modal GCC-PHAT features, entirely bypassing black-box neural networks. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that while conventional microphone arrays confidently fail due to severe attenuation and massive structural multipath, our PI-GS analytical solver mathematically unwraps the distortion, robustly isolating the target source with a mean absolute error of $1.48^\circ$ and near-zero vulnerability to jammers. Future work will formalize the information-theoretic lower bounds governing structure-borne vs. air-borne spatial coherence across diverse barrier materials.
